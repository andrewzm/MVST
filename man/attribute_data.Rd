\title{Data-attribution}
\usage{
attribute_data(df, info_df, miss_value = 0, averaging_buffer = NA)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{data frame to which data is attributed. Must contain fields \code{x} and \code{y}.}

\item{info_df}{the data-containing data frame. Must contain fields \code{x}, \code{y} and \code{z} and points must lie on an ordered grid.}

\item{miss_value}{the value attributed to data points which cannot be mapped.}

\item{averaging_buffer}{a distance radius around the values which cannot be matched to the data. The missing value will then be replaced with the average of data found in this radius. The number should be in the same lenght units as the dataset.}
}
\value{
a vector of the data mapped onto the coordinates in \code{df}
}
\description{
Attempts to attribute data in a data frame describing data on a grid to a another data frame (with irregular points in \code{x} and \code{y}. The data frame is assumed to have coordinate values as integer values. Hence, If the data-containing data frame describes a spacing of 1, a simple merge is carried out. If not a nearest-grid interpolation is carried out.
}
\examples{
df <- data.frame(x=runif(100),y=runif(100))
info_df <- cbind(expand.grid(x=seq(0,1,0.1),y=seq(0,1,0.1)),z=runif(121))
df$z <- attribute_data(df=df,info_df = info_df)
}
